# Build a Static Site using CDK

In this learning in public project, we will build a CDK static site using the following steps:

- Initialise project
- Setup and use custom domain with Route 53
- Create S3 buckets for hosting & artifacts
- Configure logging for the site
- Setup SSL using ACM and CloudFront
- Setup a Code Pipeline to build and deploy
- ... and probably other things along the way.
